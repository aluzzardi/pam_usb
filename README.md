pam\_usb
========

pam\_usb provides hardware authentication for Linux using ordinary USB Flash Drives.

It works with any application supporting PAM, such as _su_ and login managers (_GDM_, _KDM_).

Important
--------

This repository is *UNMAINTAINED* for almost ten years by now. 

You can find an up-to-date fork with many community improvements at https://github.com/mcdope/pam_usb, which also provides packages in `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.zst` format.

Thanks to the whole community for keeping pam_usb alive.


Features
--------

* `Password-less authentication.` Use your USB stick for authentication, don't type passwords anymore.
* `Device auto probing.` You don't need to mount the device, or even to configure the device location (_sda1_, _sdb1_, etc). pam\_usb.so will automatically locate the device using `UDisks` and access its data by itself.
* `Two-factor authentication.` Achieve greater security by requiring both the USB stick and the password to authenticate the user.
* `Non-intrusive.` pam\_usb doesn't require any modifications of the USB storage device to work (no additional partitions required).
* USB Serial number, model and vendor verification.
* Support for **One Time Pads** authentication.
* You can use the same device across multiple machines.
* Support for all kind of removable devices (SD, MMC, etc).

Tools
-----
* `pamusb-agent`: trigger actions (such as locking the screen) upon device authentication and removal.
* `pamusb-conf`: configuration helper.
* `pamusb-check`: integrate pam\_usb's authentication engine within your scripts or applications.
