====== Upgrading  ======

If you're already using a pamusb version prior to 0.4.0, you will have to remove
the older version before installing.

You do not have to do this if you're already using >=0.4.0 or Subversion.

===== Remove pam_usb.so from pam.d =====

$ grep -r pam_usb.so /etc/pam.d
/etc/pam.d/su:auth sufficient pam_usb.so
/etc/pam.d/gdm:auth sufficient pam_usb.so
[...]

Edit every matching file and remove the pam_usb.so lines.
At the end of the operation, there shouldn't be any file contanining a reference
to pam_usb.so:

$ grep -r pam_usb /etc/pam.d
$

=====  Remove .auth directories =====

Older versions of pamusb used to create .auth directories in both the device and
the user's home directory. Those directories aren't used anymore, so feel free
to remove them:

# rm -rf /root/.auth
# rm -rf /home/scox/.auth
# rm -rf /media/usbdisk/.auth

===== Remove configuration files =====

As configuration files of pamusb 0.4.0 aren't backward compatible and are
located under /etc/pusb, the old /etc/pam_usb is no more needed.

# rm -rf /etc/pam_usb

===== Deinstall pamusb =====

If you installed the old pamusb version using your operating system's package
manager, then remove it by the same mean.

Otherwise, you can remove it by hand by performing the following instructions:

# rm -f /usr/bin/usbadm /usr/share/man/usbadm.1.gz
# rm -f /usr/bin/usbhotplug /etc/hotplug.d/default/pamusb.hotplug
/etc/pam.d/usbhotplug
# rm -f /lib/security/pam_usb.so

===== Next =====

Go aheand and install the new version.
